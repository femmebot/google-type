Thousands have visited this project and many are using this as an ongoing reference tool to learn about typography. It's important that submissions (pull requests) demonstrate a good foundation in typography. The primary goal is to communicate, not decorate.


If you'd like to contribute to this project, that's awesome! Here are the *game rules*:
* Must use at least two fonts (typefaces) from https://www.google.com/fonts
* Must use at least one of the tales from Aesop’s Fables: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11339
* When including third-party images and similar artwork, please make sure they are public domain. [Here's a great resource for stock images that don't suck](https://medium.com/@dustin/stock-photos-that-dont-suck-62ae4bcbe01b).
* Must demonstrate a good foundation in typography. Refer to Ellen Lupton's Skillshare class, [Typography That Works: Typographic Composition and Fonts](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/design/Typography-That-Works-Typographic-Composition-and-Fonts/1694217981?via=profile) for a quick lesson. Also recommended: [practical typographic rules](http://practicaltypography.com) if you want to dig in deeper and [http://www.typography.com/techniques/](http://www.typography.com/techniques/) for pointers on combining typefaces.
