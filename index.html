                <p>A Gnat alighted on one of the horns of a Bull, and remained sitting there for a considerable time. When it had rested sufficiently and was about to fly away, it said to the Bull, &ldquo;Do you mind if I go now?&rdquo; The Bull merely raised his eyes and remarked, without interest, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all one to me; I didn&rsquo;t notice when you came, and I shan&rsquo;t know when you go away.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>We may often be of more consequence in our own eyes than in the eyes of our neighbours.</p>

                <p>An Oak that grew on the bank of a river was uprooted by a severe gale of wind, and thrown across the stream. It fell among some Reeds growing by the water, and said to them, &ldquo;How is it that you, who are so frail and slender, have managed to weather the storm, whereas I, with all my strength, have been torn up by the roots and hurled into the river?&rdquo; &ldquo;You were stubborn,&rdquo; came the reply, &ldquo;and fought against the storm, which proved stronger than you: but we bow and yield to every breeze, and thus the gale passed harmlessly over our heads.&rdquo;</p>

                <h2>The Astronomer</h2>
                <p>There was once an Astronomer whose habit it was to go out at night and observe the stars. One night, as he was walking about outside the town gates, gazing up absorbed into the sky and not looking where he was going, he fell into a dry well. As he lay there groaning, some one passing by heard him, and, coming to the edge of the well, looked down and, on learning what had happened, said, &ldquo;If you really mean to say that you were looking so hard at the sky that you didn&rsquo;t even see where your feet were carrying you along the ground, it appears to me that you deserve all you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Once upon a time all the Rivers combined to protest against the action of the Sea in making their waters salt. &ldquo;When we come to you,&rdquo; said they to the Sea, &ldquo;we are sweet and drinkable: but when once we have mingled with you, our waters become as briny and unpalatable as your own.&rdquo; The Sea replied shortly, &ldquo;Keep away from me and you&rsquo;ll remain sweet.&rdquo;</p>

                <p class="drop-p">A thirsty Crow found a Pitcher with some water in it, but so little was there that, try as she might, she could not reach it with her beak, and it seemed as though she would die of thirst within sight of the remedy.</p>

                <p>At last she hit upon a clever plan. She began dropping pebbles into the Pitcher, and with each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it reached the brim, and the knowing bird was enabled to quench her thirst.</p>

              <p>A hungry Fox saw some fine bunches of Grapes hanging from a vine that was trained along a high trellis, and did his best to reach them by jumping as high as he could into the air.

A countryman, who was a witness of the encounter, came to the assistance of the Eagle, and succeeded in freeing him from the Serpent and enabling him to escape. In revenge the Serpent spat some of his poison into the man's drinking-horn. Heated with his exertions, the man was about to slake his thirst with a draught from the horn, when the Eagle knocked it out of his hand, and spilled its contents upon the ground.</p>

                <p>Once more, when she saw the first archer, she warned the Birds that he was their deadly enemy, who would wing his arrows with their own feathers and shoot them.</p>
                <p>But they took no notice of what she said: in fact, they thought she was rather mad, and laughed at her. When, however, everything turned out as she had foretold, they changed their minds and conceived a great respect for her wisdom.</p>
                <p>Hence, whenever she appears, the Birds attend upon her in the hope of hearing something that may be for their good. She, however, gives them advice no longer, but sits moping and pondering on the folly of her kind.</p>

				<h2>The Crow and The Raven</h2>
				<p>A Crow became very jealous of a Raven, because the latter was regarded by men as a bird of omen which foretold the future, and was accordingly held in great respect by them. She was very anxious to get the same sort of reputation herself; and, one day, seeing some travellers approaching, she flew on to a branch of a tree at the roadside and cawed as loud as she could. The travellers were in some dismay at the sound, for they feared it might be a bad omen; till one of them, spying the Crow, said to his companions, <q>It&rsquo;s all right, my friends, we can go on without fear, for it&rsquo;s only a crow and that means nothing.</q></p>

                <h2>Jupiter And The Tortoise</h2>
                <p>Jupiter was about to marry a wife, and determined to celebrate the event by inviting all the animals to a banquet. They all came except the Tortoise, who did not put in an appearance, much to Jupiter&rsquo;s surprise. So when he next saw the Tortoise he asked him why he had not been at the banquet. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for going out,&rdquo; said the Tortoise; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no place like home.&rdquo; Jupiter was so much annoyed by this reply that he decreed that from that time forth the Tortoise should carry his house upon his back, and never be able to get away from home even if he wished to.</p>
