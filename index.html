Problem is, pairing typefaces isn&rsquo;t easy. And, many of the fonts in Google&rsquo;s library don&rsquo;t work well when applied to typical webpage (desktop) layouts. Part of the <a href="http://25x52.com" target="_blank">25x52</a> initiative, this collaborative, ongoing project helps provide typographic inspiration for using Google&rsquo;s web fonts for web applications.

                <h2>The Gnat<br>&amp; the Bull</h2>
                <p>A Gnat alighted on one of the horns of a Bull, and remained sitting there for a considerable time. When it had rested sufficiently and was about to fly away, it said to the Bull, &ldquo;Do you mind if I go now?&rdquo; The Bull merely raised his eyes and remarked, without interest, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all one to me; I didn&rsquo;t notice when you came, and I shan&rsquo;t know when you go away.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>We may often be of more consequence in our own eyes than in the eyes of our neighbours.</p>

                <p>An Oak that grew on the bank of a river was uprooted by a severe gale of wind, and thrown across the stream. It fell among some Reeds growing by the water, and said to them, &ldquo;How is it that you, who are so frail and slender, have managed to weather the storm, whereas I, with all my strength, have been torn up by the roots and hurled into the river?&rdquo; &ldquo;You were stubborn,&rdquo; came the reply, &ldquo;and fought against the storm, which proved stronger than you: but we bow and yield to every breeze, and thus the gale passed harmlessly over our heads.&rdquo;</p>

                <h2>The Astronomer</h2>
                <p>There was once an Astronomer whose habit it was to go out at night and observe the stars. One night, as he was walking about outside the town gates, gazing up absorbed into the sky and not looking where he was going, he fell into a dry well. As he lay there groaning, some one passing by heard him, and, coming to the edge of the well, looked down and, on learning what had happened, said, &ldquo;If you really mean to say that you were looking so hard at the sky that you didn&rsquo;t even see where your feet were carrying you along the ground, it appears to me that you deserve all you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>

                <p class="drop-p">A thirsty Crow found a Pitcher with some water in it, but so little was there that, try as she might, she could not reach it with her beak, and it seemed as though she would die of thirst within sight of the remedy.</p>

                <p>At last she hit upon a clever plan. She began dropping pebbles into the Pitcher, and with each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it reached the brim, and the knowing bird was enabled to quench her thirst.</p>

              <h2>The Fox &amp; the Grapes</h2>
              <p>A hungry Fox saw some fine bunches of Grapes hanging from a vine that was trained along a high trellis, and did his best to reach them by jumping as high as he could into the air. But it was all in vain, for they were just out of reach: so he gave up trying, and walked away with an air of dignity and unconcern, remarking, &ldquo;I thought those Grapes were ripe, but I see now they are quite sour.&rdquo;</p>

                    <h2>The Prophet</h2>
                    <p>A Prophet sat in the market-place and told the fortunes of all who cared to engage his services. Suddenly there came running up one who told him that his house had been broken into by thieves, and that they had made off with everything they could lay hands on. He was up in a moment, and rushed off, tearing his hair and calling down curses on the miscreants. The bystanders were much amused, and one of them said, &ldquo;&#8201;Our friend professes to know what is going to happen to others, but it seems he&rsquo;s not clever enough to perceive what&rsquo;s in store for himself.&rdquo;</p>
